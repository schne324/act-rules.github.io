## Applicability

This rule applies to any [HTML web page][].

## Expectation 1

Within the test target, there exists at least one [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move focus [at the start][] of the [main block of content][] of the [document][].

## Expectation 2

Within the test target, there exists at least one [instrument][] to move focus [at the start][] of the [main block of content][] of the [document][]; and this [instrument][] is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has an [accessible name][] that communicates that it skips to the [main block of content][].

## Assumptions

- This rule assumes that there is exactly one [main block of content][] inside each [HTML web page][].
- This rule assumes that [Technique G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1], [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123], and [Technique G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content][tech g124] require that the links can be [activated][activation] by use of keyboard, including being part of [sequential focus navigation][] (in order to be useful for keyboard users).
- This rule assumes that there is at least one [block of repeated content][] before the [main block of content][], and therefore [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123] will require a link to the [main block of content][] in order to skip this [block of repeated content][]. If there is no [block of repeated content][] before the [main block of content][], then it is possible to fail this rule but still pass [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123].
- This rule assumes that the language of each test target can be correctly determined (either programmatically or by analyzing the content), and sufficiently understood.

## Accessibility Support

_There are no major accessibility support issues known for this rule._

## Background

While it is clear that a "skip link" is a valid way to satisfy [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks][sc241], it is less clear how "deep" in the page such a skip link could be. Notably, [Technique G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content][tech g124] is listing valid cases where it could be fairly "deep" if the page has many areas of the content. Rather than trying to fix an arbitrary value (e.g. "the skip link must be among the first 5 focusable elements"), or trying to figure out some condition on what precedes it, this rule only checks its existence. It is clear that if no "skip link" is provided, then another way to bypass blocks of repeated content must be found. However, it is possible to pass this rule and still fail [Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass blocks][sc241] if the skip link is too far away from the start of the page.

In most practical cases, the same [instrument][] is used to fulfill both expectations since it would be wasted effort to duplicate the work.

- [Technique G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1]
- [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123]
- [Technique G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content][tech g124]

Each test case contains a link to the second chapter of the book so that each `aside` element is a [block of repeated content][]. Even though [blocks of repeated content][block of repeated content] are not considered by this rule, there is no need to provide a skip link if there is no repeated content to bypass, therefore the examples illustrate situations where the link is actually needed.

The [main block of content][] of each test case is defined by its `main` element.

Due to the differences between the 3 techniques considered here, it is almost impossible to pass all of them at the same time. The first few Passed Examples illustrate these differences and pass different techniques. The rest of the Passed Examples illustrate variations inside the rule and are based on cases that pass [Technique G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1] given that it is simpler than the other two.

The examples sometimes group the skip links inside a `nav` landmark (notably when there are several). According to [WAI-ARIA authoring practices][navigation landmark], if another `nav` landmark was present on the page (e.g. for site navigation), then each should have a different accessible name.

## Test Cases

### Passed

#### Passed Example 1

In this [document][], the first `a` element is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to [navigate][], and thus move the focus, to the [main block of content][]. It is [included in the accessibility tree][] and its [accessible name][] (coming from content) communicates that it skips to the main content. This example passes [Technique G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area][tech g1].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>

		</aside>

		<main id="main">
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 2

In this [document][], the third `a` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][]. It is [included in the accessibility tree][] and its [accessible name][] (coming from content) communicates that it skips to the main content. This example passes [Technique G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content][tech g124].

```html

		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 3

In this [document][], the second `a` element (inside the second `aside` element) is [visible][] and is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][]. It is [included in the accessibility tree][] and its [accessible name][] (coming from content) communicates that it skips to the main content. This example passes [Technique G123: Adding a link at the beginning of a block of repeated content to go to the end of the block][tech g123].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>

			<a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter1.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 4

In this [document][], the first `a` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][], is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a descriptive [accessible name][]. In this case, the element is normally hidden but is [visible][] when [focused][].

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/styles.css" />
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<nav class="visible-on-focus">
			<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>
		</nav>

		<aside id="about-book">
			<h1>About the book</h1>
			<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
		</aside>

		<main id="main">
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span

			</p>
			<a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter1.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 5

In this [document][], the first `div` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][], is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a descriptive [accessible name][]. In this case, the [activation][] behavior, and the possibility to [activate][activation] the element with keyboard, is done by scripting and the `tabindex` attribute with a value of 0.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<script src="../test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/click-on-enter.js"></script>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body onload="ClickOnEnter('skip-link')">
		<div role="link" onclick="location.assign('#main');" tabindex="0" id="skip-link">Skip to main content</div>

		<aside id="about-book">
			<h1>About the book</h1>
			<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
		</aside>

		<main id="main">
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
			<a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter1.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 6

In this [document][], the first `a` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][], is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a descriptive [accessible name][]. Even though its target is inside another [block of content][], it is still [at the start][] of the [main block of content][] because there is no [perceivable content][] between the link target and the [main block of content][]. Thus, following the link does skip all the repeated content.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>

		<aside id="about-book">
			<h1>About the book</h1>
			<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a 14th century historical novel.</p>
			<span id="main"></span>
		</aside>

		<main>
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span
				of time.
			</p>
			<a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter1.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 7

In this [document][], the first `a` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][], is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a descriptive [accessible name][]. Even though its target is not the first element in it, it is still [at the start][] of the [main block of content][] because it is before any [perceivable content][] inside the [main block of content][]. Thus, following the link does not skip any non-repeated content.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#main">Skip to main content</a>

			<span id="main"></span>
			<h1>Three Heroes Swear Brotherhood at a Feast in the Peach Garden</h1>
			<p>
				Unity succeeds division and division follows unity. One is bound to be replaced by the other after a long span

			</p>
			<a href="/test-assets/bypass-blocks-cf77f2/chapter1.html">Read Chapter 2</a>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

#### Passed Example 8

In this [document][], the first `a` element is [visible][], is a [keyboard actionable][] [instrument][] to move the focus to the [main block of content][], is [included in the accessibility tree][] and has a descriptive [accessible name][]. In this case, the link is rendered as non-text content and has an [accessible name][] given by its `aria-label` attribute.

```html
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<title>The Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<a href="#main" aria-label="Skip to main content">📖</a>

#### Failed Example 8

In this [document][], the first [focusable][] element does not move focus [at the start][] of the [main block of content][]. The focus is moved after the start, on [perceivable content][] which is not the first inside the [main block of content][]. Thus, following the link does skip part of the non-repeated content and users will miss some important information.
